# Getting the notebooks and data

The **PIMA dataset** is available on Kaggle at the following address:

https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

If you are registered in the workshop mailing list, you also received a copy by email.

The three notebooks we will be working on are :
* Data scientist notebook : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X_5izIrmllnDcVak0Dlw3tgzOFhbL--N?usp=sharing


* Data Owner 1 notebook:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XCGLaohKql024ibkbShX8NEPmPQz2TKW?usp=sharing


* Data Owner 2 notebook:

# Connecting the notebooks to a local environment
Google Colab works by attributing resources on Google servers. They tend to be unreliable and disconnect, which will impact negatively your experience in this training, especially because it is sometimes necessary to reinstall all dependencies and start again from scratch. We recommend doing the local environment setup if you are able to.

## If you do not wish to connect the notebooks to a local environment:
You can stop reading this resource.

## If you are already familiar with Jupyter, conda/pip (or brave enough to try installing it):

Follow these instructions that will help you getting a Jupyter server online :

Alternatively, you can of course download the .ipynb files (*File>Download*) and simply run them in the Jupyter editor instead of Colab.

As described in the instructions linked above, you should have a running Jupyter console providing such a link:
